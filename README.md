# Space ship 🚀

## the game of the future (or maybe not)

For the Ironhack web dev bootcamp we developed a game in HTML5 and JavaScript using Canvas. This is the result of week long work.

The goal of the game is very simple, you control a space ship in its horizontal axis and enemies keep coming from above. Just shoot at them and destroy the flying saucers! 🛸

For each enemy killed your score increases by one, and by each enemy that passes by you, you lose a life. For every 10 saucers destroyed you go up a level, with more and faster saucers coming! 

Oh I almost forgot ocasionally red hearts fall from the sky, so CATCH THEM, those are lives. ❤️

In the end of all of the saucers destroyed, the mighty evil BOSS comes your way! Be careful he shoots back. 😮

Go ahead and try to defeat the Boss (good luck) and win the game! 🏆

All credits for this awesome game goes to JRPedrosa and GMonteiro74.
